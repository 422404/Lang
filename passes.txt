Out of order passes:
- OK: expand class blocks: .public { a: Int; b: Int; } --> .public a: Int; .public a: Int;
- OK: put SourceFile in hashmap with namespace as key and Vec<SourceFile> as value
- Ok: Check methods body:
    --> normal classes don't have bodyless methods unless they are natives
    --> abstract classes can have bodyless methods with .abstract attributes
    --> interfaces have only bodyless methods, these are not .abstract

- Check freestanding functions body:
    --> only native functions can be bodyless
- Collect symbols
- Type checking
- Validate attributes:
    --> make a list of reserved attributes
    --> check attributes mutual exclusivity
- Constants unfold
